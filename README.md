# NBA Analysis


This project was carried out in three main phases, each building on the previous to create a complete data pipeline and analysis.

Phase 1 – Data Scraping

We began by scraping data from a target website. This involved carefully navigating the structure of the site and selecting the data relevant to our assigned tasks. We worked with Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup (bs4), Requests, and Selenium to automate the collection and extraction process.

Phase 2 – Data Structuring & Storage

Once collected, the raw data was transformed into a format suitable for storage and analysis. We designed and implemented a MySQL database to house the data, then exported cleaned and structured subsets into Excel sheets. This step included extensive data cleaning to ensure consistency and usability.

Phase 3 – Statistical Analysis & Insights

With a clean dataset in place, we moved on to statistical analysis. We started with data visualization to gain an initial understanding of trends and patterns. From there, we conducted hypothesis testing to uncover deeper insights and validate our observations. This marked the final stage of the project, wrapping up with both visual and statistical interpretations of the data.
